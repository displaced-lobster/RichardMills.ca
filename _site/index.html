        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently a 4<sup>th</sup> year computer science student at MacEwan University and will be completing my studies in December 2019. I have project management experience and passion that I believe could benefit a potential employer.</p>
<p>I am a former Oil Sands engineer making a career change to software development.
I have chosen to make this career change because I have a deep interest in computer science and would like to bring this passion to my work and to benefit my employer.
Computer science provides me the skills and knowledge to do what I love, while my engineering and project management experience gives me the required communication and problem solving skills to be successful in this position.
Software development allows me to design and build elegant solutions to challenging problems.
I have a love for building and designing and I have completed numerous extracurricular projects in a variety of programming languages.
I can bring experience in building full stack projects to an employer. I am in the early stages of developing a web app to allow users with acne to track their outbreaks; my largest personal project to date.
My personal project, <a href="aperioapp.com">Aperioapp.com</a> is currently in a data collection stage with future plans to implement analysis of user's skin history to attempt to identify potential outbreak triggers.
I am eager to apply my experience in working with your company.</p>
<p>I am available to interview for a position and look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your consideration.</p>
