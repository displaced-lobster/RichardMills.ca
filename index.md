I am a software developer working for a [QuoteToMe](https://quotetome.com), an Edmonton based start-up. During the day, I develop in Python and VueJS working both backends and frontends to grow an ever-increasing feature-set to meet the demands of construction purchasing. During the night, I dabble in Rust, Go, more VueJS, and more Python, and whatever else suits my fancy at any given time. Between bouts of coding, I enjoy rock climbing, mountain biking, and 3D printing. I enjoy creating, developing, problem solving, and kicking butt with a great team of people.

I started work at QuoteToMe January 2020 and it has been a wild ride ever since. Since I have started, we have released a new web app and a mobile app. We have developed a great set of internal tools as well as increased our application features to an ever-increasing number of customers. Working for a start-up has been a dream of mine and it has not disappointed.
